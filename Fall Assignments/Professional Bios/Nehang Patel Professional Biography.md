## **Project Sought**

I am seeking a senior design project that allows me to apply and further develop the technical skills and knowledge I have acquired through my previous co-op experiences. Specifically, I am interested in a project that integrates multiple facets of software development and engineering, including:

- Software Development: Utilizing my experience in programming languages such as Python, Golang, and C++, along with frameworks like Flutter, to create a comprehensive and functional software application. This could involve designing user interfaces, integrating backend services, and optimizing performance.

- Web Scraping and Data Management: Applying my skills in web scraping (using tools like Beautiful Soup and Selenium) and data processing (including data extraction, transformation, and quality assurance) to develop a system that collects, manages, and analyzes data from various sources.

- Interdisciplinary Approach: Engaging in a project that requires collaboration across different technical domains, allowing me to bring together my expertise in software development, data management, and engineering design to create a cohesive and impactful solution.

I am eager to undertake a project that challenges me to integrate these skills and contribute to a meaningful and innovative outcome. My goal is to work on a project that not only applies my current expertise but also pushes the boundaries of my knowledge and capabilities in a practical and impactful way.
