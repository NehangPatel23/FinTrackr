# Project Constraints

In designing FinTrackr, our comprehensive personal finance management app, we must navigate several constraints that could impact our solutions.

**Economically**, we face financial limitations as our development relies on free and open-source tools to manage our budget effectively. Since our funding primarily comes from personal resources, we are restricted in purchasing premium software or services, which could limit certain advanced functionalities. However, leveraging free resources could also promote accessibility for our target users, potentially contributing to economic development by enhancing their financial literacy and decision-making capabilities. We hope to reserve premium features for a future time when we have the appropriate budget for it.

**Legally**, the project must comply with various regulations concerning intellectual property and user data privacy. As FinTrackr integrates third-party APIs for features such as stock market recommendations and subscription tracking, we need to ensure that our use of these APIs adheres to licensing agreements and avoids infringing on existing intellectual property. Additionally, as our application will handle sensitive financial information, it is crucial to comply with data protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA to safeguard user privacy and build trust.

**Socially**, FinTrackr aims to serve a significant public interest by providing users with tools to improve their financial literacy and overall quality of life. Our project is particularly focused on empowering users to manage their finances more effectively, which can lead to better financial habits and less economic stress. Collaborating with non-profit organizations may enhance our outreach to underserved communities, ensuring that the benefits of our app reach those who need financial assistance the most. By addressing these constraints, we hope to develop a responsible and impactful solution that not only simplifies personal finance management but also fosters long-term financial well-being for our users.
