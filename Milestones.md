# Project Milestones

We have identified the following major milestones for our project:

## 1. Development of "Add Expenses" Page - OCR

This milestone focuses on creating the "Add Expenses" page, where users can input their expenses. The implementation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology will enable the application to extract data from images of receipts, making it easier for users to log expenses accurately and efficiently. This involves:

- Designing the user interface for the page.
- Researching and developing the logic and code required for the OCR functionality.
- Ensuring that the OCR effectively recognizes and extracts relevant information from different receipt formats.

## 2. Development of "Tax" Page - Database APIs

This milestone encompasses the creation of the "Tax" page, which will provide users with tax-related functionalities. Key components include:

- Developing a database API that can pull relevant tax data based on user inputs, such as income level or region.
- Creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to calculate their taxes effectively.
- Integrating the tax calculation logic with the database API to ensure accurate results.

## 3. Development of "Debt" Page - Visualizations

This milestone aims to provide users with tools for managing and understanding their debts. It will involve:

- Designing the user interface for the "Debt" page, focusing on clarity and usability.
- Developing mathematical formulas and visualizations that help users track their debt repayment progress, interest accumulation, and overall financial health.
- Implementing educational content that guides users on best practices for debt repayment.

## 4. Development of "Stocks" Page - APIs, In-App Notifications, Visualizations

This milestone will focus on creating a comprehensive "Stocks" page that provides users with real-time stock information and educational content. Key tasks include:

- Designing and developing the user interface for the "Stocks" page.
- Integrating APIs to pull real-time stock data and trends, allowing users to make informed investment decisions.
- Implementing in-app notifications to keep users updated on significant stock changes, news, or educational content.
- Developing visualizations that present stock trends and user investments clearly and effectively.

## 5. Authentication and User Persona Development - FirebaseAuth

This milestone focuses on creating a secure authentication system for the application using FirebaseAuth. It involves:

- Implementing user authentication features, including login, logout, and account creation functionalities.
- Developing user personas to tailor the application experience based on user profiles and preferences.
- Ensuring data security and privacy for all user accounts and personal information.
