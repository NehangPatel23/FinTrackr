# Senior Design Final Reflection – Nehang Patel

As a dedicated contributor to the FinTrackr project, I took the lead on designing and implementing several core pages that directly shaped the user experience of our app. My responsibilities included designing the landing page, “Add Transaction” page, “Taxes” page, and the “Settings” page. I focused on ensuring both frontend aesthetics and backend functionality were well-aligned. For the Landing Page, I implemented real-time expense tracking with a clear transaction history interface. The “Add Transaction” page allowed seamless data entry, and I made sure it was both responsive and robust. The “Taxes” page required thoughtful design to accommodate multiple user inputs such as dependents, filing status, and income, and produce meaningful tax estimates. Lastly, the “Settings” page allowed for customizations and information pages such as the FAQ, Contact Us, etc. Alongside these features, I also linked these interfaces to Firebase, enabling persistent storage and retrieval of user data across the app. Lastly, I worked on the user authentication to enable multiple users to either log in or register as a new user.

This project offered the perfect opportunity to apply and expand upon the goals I had set for myself in the Fall—namely, deepening my understanding of full-stack mobile development using Flutter and improving my ability to architect clean, modular, and maintainable code. Throughout development, I strengthened my knowledge of the Dart programming language, became comfortable working with the bloc state management pattern, and learned how to use Cloud Firestore for user data handling. One major challenge I faced was implementing dark mode without breaking existing UI constraints—something that required me to understand Flutter's theming system deeply and refactor several widgets to support dynamic style switching. Another difficulty came with trying to design an effective way to track income, which was difficult to achieve within limited time frame we had for the completion of the project. Despite these roadblocks, I actively contributed to bug fixes, including resolving layout overflows and keyboard interactions, and assisted in debugging issues on other pages of the app as well. These experiences helped me build confidence in both individual development and team-based problem-solving under real-world constraints. Additionally, working through this project gave me a strong appreciation for the intersection of user experience design and functional programming. Designing for finance means everything needs to work cleanly and predictably—users need accurate outputs, fast load times, and responsive input feedback. I learned to implement form validation dynamically, make meaningful use of Flutter widgets, and manage asynchronous backend calls gracefully. Ultimately, I’m proud of the clean, readable code I produced and the positive user experience my components delivered. More importantly, I emerged with real confidence in mobile app development, backend integration, and cross-platform UI design.
