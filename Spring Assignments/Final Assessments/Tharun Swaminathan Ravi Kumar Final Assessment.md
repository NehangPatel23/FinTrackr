# Individual Self Assessment - Tharun Swaminathan Ravi Kumar

During the Senior Design project, my primary personal contribution was the complete design and
implementation of the Debt page within our FinTrackr app. I was responsible for both frontend
UI/UX and backend logic that facilitates user interaction, calculations, and data storage. Apart
from this, I also engaged proactively in alpha and beta testing loops, fixing large bugs and
optimizing the app's performance and stability. All this allowed me to directly apply and
leverage the skills I had jotted down for myself last fallâ€”especially mobile app development
with Flutter, user-oriented design, and debugging complex systems.

These experiences reaffirmed my technical proficiency level with Flutter and Dart, taught me
more about how to test and debug properly, and imparted rich experience in problem-solving
under time constraints. Highlights of my greatest successes included fixing a critical logic bug
leading to incorrect debt calculations and re-designing one part of the user interface for greater
usability based on test feedback. One of the key challenges I had was ensuring flawless
integration between frontend and backend aspects, particularly as we expanded our feature set
and neared a stable beta launch. This took a lot of trial and error, reading manual pages and
online forums, and open communication with team members to avoid conflicts or duplication of
effort.
