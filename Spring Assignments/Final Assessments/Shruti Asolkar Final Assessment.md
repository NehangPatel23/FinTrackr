# Individual Self Assessment - Shruti Asolkar

Over the course of the senior design project, my primary contributions to FinTrackr focused on backend integration, feature development, and ensuring a smooth user experience through effective error handling and responsive UI implementation. I played a key role in building out critical functionalities such as the stock market interface and linking it to the other pages. This involved extensive use of Flutter and Dart, and I built on my existing knowledge of backend data flow, asynchronous programming, and API communication. I also helped resolve frontend issues related to layout constraints, keyboard overlap, and state management to improve cross-platform usability. By actively debugging widget build errors and layout overflow problems, I strengthened my problem-solving and Flutter development skills.

Reflecting on my initial self-assessment from last Fall, I had set out to strengthen my full-stack development skills and explore AI/ML techniques within the context of a real-world finance application. I built upon my experience with Java, Spring, and full-stack projects by taking on tasks that involved API integration, backend logic, and UI responsiveness in Flutter. One of my key contributions was designing the stocks page feature and other smaller features to make the user experience better. I implemented features like favoriting stocks, filtering stocks, and showing dynamic real-time graphs of stock performance, which strengthened my ability to use APIs for various types of outputs. I did all this while ensuring accurate data flow between modules. I also implemented error handling using SnackBars and dynamic form validation to improve user experience. While I didn’t get to explore AI/ML integration to the extent I originally envisioned, I gained valuable experience working with financial data APIs and modular code design. A major obstacle I faced was syncing the budgeting and debt modules across screens without introducing inconsistencies, which pushed me to improve my state management and asynchronous programming skills. I feel that I succeeded in delivering clean, maintainable code that supported our team’s shared goal of creating a robust and user-friendly app.
