# Fall + Spring Timekeeping

This document contains all the timekeeping notes for all members for both Fall and Spring Semesters. There are tables showing our weekly hours spent on the project and following those will be weekly justifications for each team member for time spent on the project. We did all the work (planning, designing, development, testing) together in team meetings, so every member's individual hours are similar.
